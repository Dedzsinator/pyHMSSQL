## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB
- pymongo

See requirements.txt for the full and updated list of dependencies.

## üîß Installation

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyHMSSQL.git
cd pyHMSSQL
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- On Windows:
  - Ensure MongoDB is running

- On Linux:
  - W.I.P

## üöÄ Quick Start

Start the server:

```bash
cd server
python server.py
```

Start the CLI client:

```bash
cd client
python cli_client.py
```

Start the GUI client:

```bash
cd client
python gui_client.py
```

## üìù Example Commands

```bash
-- Create a new database
DBMS> create database mydb

-- Create a table
DBMS> create table mydb users id:int name:varchar age:int

-- Create an index on the name column
DBMS> create index mydb users idx_name name

-- Insert data
DBMS> query INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 30)

-- Query data
DBMS> query SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice'

-- Delete data
DBMS> query DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1
```

## üìä Architecture

pyHMSSQL follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

Client Layer: Handles user interaction through CLI or GUI
Server Layer: Processes requests and manages database operations
Storage Layer: Persists data and metadata using MongoDB
Index Layer: Optimizes data retrieval using B+ trees
For more details, see ARCHITECTURE.md.
